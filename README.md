# GOLFU
In-memory cache system
- plug your cold storage on it to eventually persist all setted data
- auto eviction by read count (LFU); only evicts persisted data
- retrieves all cache-miss from the cold storage
- "eventual" persistency (async if you will) allows non-blocking set operation
- you will see everything you need to implement or use and a couple helpers func & struct in /storage
## ctx
Don't use in production lol <br>
